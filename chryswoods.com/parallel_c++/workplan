# Part 1 = C++ version of Parallel Python Part 1

    # Functional Programming
    # Functions as objects
    # Mapping functions
    # Reduction
    # Anonymous functions (lambda)

# Part 2 = TBB

    # TBB - what is it, how to use it
    # parallel_for - this is a (semi) drop-in replacement for "for"
       # range

    # parallel_map - using parallel_for to write a parallel_map
       # update countlines to run in parallel

    # parallel_reduce - this is parallel_for combined with a
       parallel version of reduce

       # do processor-intensive version of countlines

    # asynchronous functions (tasks)

    # nested parallelism

    # understanding the task scheduler

## Future
