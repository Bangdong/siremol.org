# Monte Carlo Methods for Biomodelling

Welcome to a short course that will introduce Monte Carlo methods for modelling biomolecules. This is a self-guided course and you can work at your own pace. All of the answers to the questions are provided. Please take a look at the answers if you are stuck or want to check your work. This website will be online permanently, so do not feel that you have to rush. You are welcome to continue this workshop after you go home.

 This course is divided into two parts.
