# Monte Carlo Methods for Biomodelling : Part 1

The first part of this course will provide an introduction to Monte Carlo. For simplicitly, the techniques will be demonstrated on small systems. However, they can be applied just as well on large biomolecular systems.

This course will introduce the application of Monte Carlo. If you are interested in the theory, please take a look at [these slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_KkGMZ8ACfaa2k4eVljODN3X1k/edit?usp=sharing) which provide full details on the background of the method.

This course assumes that you have a basic knowledge of Python. If you are not comfortable with Python, then please take a look at this [introduction to python course](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python).
