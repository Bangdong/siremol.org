# Positions available in the Bristol RSE Group

A new and exciting opportunity has arisen for an enthusiastic and highly motivated Research Software Engineer (RSE) to join the School of Chemistry as part of the newly-funded CCP-BioSim EPSRC Software Flagship project.
 
CCP-BioSim is the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation, a UK-wide project to support and develop the field of biomolecular simulation (www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk). CCP-BioSim was established in October 2011 with support from EPSRC to strengthen, promote and develop biomolecular simulation at the life sciences interface, an area that is increasingly contributing to biology, biocatalysis and important in drug design. CCP-BioSim aims to identify methodological and computational challenges in this growing field, and develop links between academia and industry, and between theorists and experimentalists. We develop software for the broad biomolecular simulation community, and make it accessible to experts and non-experts, in the UK and abroad. We have recently been awarded new funding from the EPSRC to support Flagship Software Development. This will involve developing a C++/Python framework that will link together the spectrum of applications used by our community into a single workflow development environment, called BioSimSpace. The software will be based on [Sire](https://siremol.org), and will involve building interfaces to software such as [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org), [FESetup](http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/fesetup), [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) and [ProtoMS](http://protoms.org).
 
The post holder will be a member of the ACRC Research Software Engineering group, under the direct supervision of Dr Christopher Woods (EPSRC RSE Fellow) working as part of the CCP-BioSim Flagship Software Development Team; Prof Adrian Mulholland (Chair, CCP-BioSim; University of Bristol), Dr Julien Michel (University of Edinburgh), Dr Antonia Mey (University of Edinburgh), Prof Charles Laughton (University of Nottingham), and Prof Francesco Gervasio (UCL). This is an ideal opportunity as an entry level RSE post that will provide support and training for you to develop your career as a Research Software Engineer.
 
The post is available on a full time basis, with fixed funding confirmed until 31st May 2019. [More information about the role can be found here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details.html?nPostingId=5949&nPostingTargetId=22609&id=Q50FK026203F3VBQBV7V77V83&LG=UK&mask=uobext).
