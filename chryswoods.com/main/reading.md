# Good Books to Read

I am often asked to recommend good text books for different subjects. 
Here is a list of textbooks that I think are the best. I've used many
of these, either as a student or as a teacher. While I have linked 
to amazon, this isn't a paid link, and you shouldn't feel any compulsion
to buy the books from them.

## Books on programming

* [Programming: Principles and Practice using C++](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C/dp/0321992784/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1441988297&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=stroustrup+swan).
  This is my favourite programming book and is the perfect book to use to start
  to learn C++ (or indeed the basics of any compiled programming language). This
  book will show you why the language is designed the way it is, and will give
  you the foundation to become a really skilled programmer and program designer.

* [The C++ Programming Language](http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0321563840/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441988297&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=stroustrup+swan)
  This is the best C++ reference book, providing both clear explanations and an 
  in-depth reference for the C++ language. Every C++ programmer should have a copy. 

* [C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Template-Metaprogramming-Concepts-Techniques-Beyond/dp/0321227255/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988459&sr=1-1&keywords=template+metaprogramming)
  An amazingly clear and detailed introduction to template metaprogramming. This
  is an advanced book, but you know that you are on the way to becoming a skilled
  programmer once you have worked your way to the end.

* [Python Essential Reference](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Essential-Reference-Developers-Library/dp/0672329786/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988534&sr=1-2&keywords=essential+python)
  This is the book from which I learned Python. An indispensible reference manual,
  plus the first few chapters are the best introduction to Python that I have ever
  seen.

* [Learning Python](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988620&sr=1-1&keywords=learning+python)
  I didn't use it to learn Python, but I know many people who have. A really
  good introduction to Python.

## Books on molecular modelling

* [Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Quantum-Chemistry-Introduction-Electronic/dp/0486691861/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988665&sr=1-1&keywords=szabo+ostlund)
  THE book to truly understand Hartree Fock theory and beyond. This will give you
  a strong foundation in quantum chemistry, and you will even learn how to write
  your own Hartree Fock program.

* [Computer Simulation of Liquids](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Computer-Simulation-Tildesley-published-University/dp/B00E325X30/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988736&sr=1-1&keywords=allen+tildesley)
  The book I first used to learn molecular dynamics and molecular modelling. A classic
  of the field and you will even learn how to write your own dynamics program.

* [Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Molecular-Modelling-Applications-Andrew-Leach/dp/0582382106/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988789&sr=1-1&keywords=leach+molecular+modelling)
  Another classic book from which I learned computational chemistry. A really
  good, simple introduction to the entire field.

* [Statistical Mechanics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Statistical-Mechanics-Donald-McQuarrie/dp/1891389157/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441988860&sr=1-5&keywords=statistical+mechanics)
  Does exactly what it says on the tin. The most complete book on statistical
  mechanics and the tome that led me through my PhD and early PostDoc years.
