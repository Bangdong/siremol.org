#What's next?

This course was designed to give you a quick taster of MPI. If you enjoyed it, 
and want to learn more, then I strongly encourage you to take a look at a 
book on MPI, e.g. 
[Using MPI: Portable Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing Interface](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Using-MPI-Programming-Message-Passing-Engineering/dp/0262571323/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1329953725&sr=8-3) , 
or to check out 
[other](http://www.mpi-forum.org/) 
[MPI](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/)
[websites](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/tutorial/) 
or performing a web search for 
[mpi tutorial](http://www.google.com/search?q='mpi%20tutorial') or 
[mpi for beginners](http://www.google.com/search?q='mpi%20for%20beginners').

The best way to learn any programming language or tool is to read other people's 
code and copy it. Please feel free to copy, adapt and play with the examples 
in this workshop. They should hopefully provide the starting points for basic 
parallelisation of your code using MPI.
