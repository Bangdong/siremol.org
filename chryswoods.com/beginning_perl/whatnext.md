#What's next?

If this has whet your appetite for Perl then I really recommend that 
you get hold of a Perl book (like [Programming Perl](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596000278/) and 
[Learning Perl](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Perl-Randal-L-Schwartz/dp/0596101058/)). 
There are also hundreds of Perl tutorials on the web (just perform a web search for 
[perl tutorial](http://www.google.com/search?q='perl%20tutorial') or 
[perl for beginners](http://www.google.com/search?q='perl%20for%20beginners')). 
For example, you can find some good training material [here](http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/perl/).

The best way to learn Perl though is to read other people's Perl and copy it. 
Please feel free to copy, adapt and play with the examples in this workshop. 
They should hopefully provide the starting points for a range of simple tasks 
that you may wish to perform using Perl.

Happy perling!
