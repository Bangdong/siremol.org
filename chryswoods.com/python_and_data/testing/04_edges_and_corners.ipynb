    "So far we have been testing simple functions that take, at most, two parameters as arguments. There are no complex algorithms or logic at work, so the functions shouldn't behave differently depending on the input. The failure of these functions is down to our (I mean my) poor programming, rather than anything fundamentally complicated in their workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is often not the case. Functions might require many parameters and their execution and output can vary wildly depending on the input. In many cases there might be a _normal_ range of parameter space where the function output is easy to predict, then other regions where the behaviour can be much more complex. When writing tests it is important that you cover as many cases as possible. You should push the boundaries of your software to make sure that it works as expected across the entire range of input under which it is meant to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing in this manner is often referred to as covering _edge_ and _corner_ cases. Typically, edge cases test situations where one parameter is at an extreme value, while corner cases test two (or more in a multidimensional problems) edge cases simultaneously. However, sometimes the definition isn't so clear. (The principle of testing unusual input holds, though.)\n",
