    "# Pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) has rapidly established itself as the standard python testing framework. Its power lies in its simplicity, which makes it super easy to write tests and to run them. Tests can be as simple as the ones that we've already seen, so it is perfect for small projects. However, hidden behind the simple exterior `pytest` provides a great deal of power and flexibility, meaning that it scales well to large and complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will learn how to automatically find and run tests using `pytest`, then query and interpret the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytest comes with a command-line tool called, unsurprisingly, `pytest`. (With older versions of python this was called `py.test`.) When run, `pytest` searches for tests in all directories and files below the current directory, collects the tests together, then runs them. Pytest uses name matching to locate the tests. Valid names start or end with `test`, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Files:\n",
    "test_file.py       file_test.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions:\n",
    "def test_func():   def func_test():\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will use the convention of `test_*` when naming files and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify one or more paths and `pytest` will only look for tests in those paths, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest /path/to/my/awesome/module\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the name of a file (or files) containing test functions, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest /path/to/my/awesome/module/test/tests.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a python package it is good practice to set up a directory structure in order to keep things tidy. Throughout this course we will use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mypkg/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    whizz.py\n",
    "    bang.py\n",
    "    test/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        test_whizz.py\n",
    "        test_bang.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the `__init__.py` files makes python aware that the directory should be treated as a package (a collection of python modules). Assuming we're in the top level directory (where our notebooks reside) this allows us to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mypkg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in and run some tests using `mypkg` that was introduced in the previous section."

    "\n",
    "Let's switch to the terminal and try to work out why the test was failing. Since we know that `test_greaterThan` was the culprit, let's look at the `greaterThan` function in `mypkg/mymodule.py` to see what could be going wrong.\n",
