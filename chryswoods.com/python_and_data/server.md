# Servers

All of the workshops will be run on a cloud JupyterHub server that you will connect to using a web browser on your laptop.

You will each have been given a numbered user account, from `train01` to `train40`.

Please log on to the server based on your user account:

* `train01` - `train16` : [Server 1](http://pydata1.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:8000)
* `train17` - `train32` : [Server 2](http://pydata2.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:8000)
* `train33` - `train40` : [Server 3](http://pydata3.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:8000)

The password to log onto the server will be written on the whiteboard in the workshop room.
