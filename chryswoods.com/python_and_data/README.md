# Intermediate Python and Data Analysis Workshop

## Description

Do you already know a little Python? Do you want to learn a little more? 
Take your programming skills to the next level in this free, two-day workshop 
on Python and data analysis. Develop your Python knowledge. Learn about 
functions, classes and modules. Discover how to structure, document 
and test your code. Explore how to use Git for version control, and 
how to use Python for data analysis and graphing via NumPy, SciPy, 
MatPlotLib and Pandas. This course is open to staff and postgraduate 
researchers from any discipline from all four GW4 institutions 
(the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter).

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a basic knowledge of Python and an awareness 
of version control and/or Git to attend this workshop. If you are 
comfortable with the concepts covered in https://chryswoods.com/beginning_python, 
and you are aware of the Git commands 
[git commit](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_git/committing.html), 
and [git add](http://chryswoods.com/beginning_git/adding.html)
then you should have no problems.

You will need to bring a wifi-enabled laptop on which you have a modern web browser (e.g. 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/features.html), 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/), 
[Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204416), 
[Internet Explorer >= 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/internet-explorer.aspx) or 
[Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/microsoft-edge)). This is because we will be using
[Jupyter](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) to run 
the entire workshop from [within your web browser](server.md). Unfortunately, Opera is not supported.

Both [eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org) and [The Cloud](https://www.skywifi.cloud) wireless services will be available on the day and you must be able
to connect to one of these. If you think you will have difficulties setting up your laptop, then
please ensure you arrive early on Thursday so that we have time to help you get connected
before the workshop starts.

You should also have created free [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.com) accounts before attending this workshop,
and be sure to link your Travis account to your GitHub account (e.g. using the "Sign in with GitHub" button 
on the Travis homepage). Note that a Bitbucket or 
GitLab account is not sufficient, as the Git lesson will involve everyone working in a
shared GitHub repository, and the continuous integration lesson will show you how to connect GitHub to Travis.

## Accommodation

Attendees are responsible for arranging their own accommodation and their own meals. There are many hotels and cafes/restaurants within walking distance of the venue.

## Instructors

Chris Edsall, Christopher Woods, Lester Hedges and Matt Williams are 
all Research Software Engineers (RSEs) working in the Advanced 
Computing Research Centre at the University of Bristol. They have 
extensive experience of using Python for data analysis in real research contexts.

## Feedback Survey

Please complete the [short feedback survey](survey.md) once you have attended the workshop.
