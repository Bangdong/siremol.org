# Intermediate Python and Data Analysis Workshop

## Description

Do you already know a little Python? Do you want to learn a little more? 
Take your programming skills to the next level in this free, two-day workshop 
on Python and data analysis. Develop your Python knowledge. Learn about 
functions, classes and modules. Discover how to structure, document 
and test your code. Explore how to use Git for version control, and 
how to use Python for data analysis and graphing via NumPy, SciPy, 
MatPlotLib and Pandas. This course is open to staff and postgraduate 
researchers from any discipline from all four GW4 institutions 
(the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter).

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a basic knowledge of Python and an awareness 
of version control and/or Git to attend this workshop. If you are 
comfortable with the concepts covered in https://chryswoods.com/beginning_python, 
you should have no problems.

You will need to bring a wifi-enabled laptop onto which you have pre-installed 
Anaconda Python and Git. *More instructions, together with a script to test 
your installation will be provided here in November*.

Both eduroam and The Cloud wireless services will be available on the day.

You should also have created free GitHub, Travis and Azure Jupyter 
accounts before attending this workshop. 
More information and instructions on how to create these accounts, 
and link Travis to GitHub are available will be provided here in November.

## Accommodation

Attendees are responsible for arranging their own accommodation and their own meals. There are many hotels and cafes/restaurants within walking distance of the venue.

## Instructors

Chris Edsall, Christopher Woods, Lester Hedges and Matt Williams are 
all Research Software Engineers (RSEs) working in the Advanced 
Computing Research Centre at the University of Bristol. They have 
extensive experience of using Python for data analysis in real research contexts.
