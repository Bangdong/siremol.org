# Data Analysis using NumPy and MatPlotLib

This course will be run via a [JupyterHub server](../server.md). Once you have logged onto the server you
will find a set of directories, one for each session. The material
for this session is in the `data2` directory.

If you have jupyter installed on your computer, you can download all
of the material here: [data2.zip](https://github.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/raw/master/chryswoods.com/python_and_data/data2.zip)

Unzip the download and then open the notebooks using your local installation
of jupyter.
