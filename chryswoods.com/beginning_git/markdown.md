# Markdown

In the last page we saw that GitHub had automatically rendered `README.md` into
a (reasonable-ish) web page. This is because `README.md` was written in a very
simple markup language called [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Markdown is a very simple text language that is a bit like a wiki language, 
and allows plain text to be easily converted to a richly formatted webpage.

Believe it or not, this entire course and website are written in markdown!
And all hosted on GitHub! To see, you can see the raw text for this page
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/master/chryswoods.com/beginning_git/markdown.md),
and the GitHub-rendered version of this page [here](https://github.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/blob/master/chryswoods.com/beginning_git/markdown.md).

The combination of GitHub and Markdown allows you to easily build wiki-like
websites and documentation, and it is now becoming common best practice for 
software projects on GitHub to have associated documentation and "readme"
files written in Markdown.

A good cheat-sheet that describes the possibilities of Markdown is 
[given here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

In short

* Headings are signified using a \# sign, with the more \#'s signifying a smaller heading.
* Links are given using square and round brackets, e.g. \[text on screen\]\(http://link.html\) would print a link showing "text on screen", linking to the site "http://link.html"
* Asterisks are used for unordered lists, e.g. take a look at the [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chryswoods/siremol.org/master/chryswoods.com/beginning_git/markdown.md) for this page to see this list.
* You can link automatically to other markdown files by just linking to the filename, e.g. \[link to this file\]\(markdown.md\) would show [link to this file](markdown.md).
