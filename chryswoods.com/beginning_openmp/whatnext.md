#What's next?

This course was designed to give you a quick taster of OpenMP. If you enjoyed it, 
and want to learn more, then I strongly encourage you to take a look at a book on OpenMP, 
e.g. [Using OpenMP: Portable Shared Memory Parallel Programming](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Using-OpenMP-Programming-Computation-Engineering/dp/0262533022/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256806054&sr=8-1), 
or to check out 
[other](http://www.openmp.org/)
[OpenMP](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/edison/programming/using-openmp/openmp-resources/)
[websites](http://www.compunity.org/) or performing a web search 
for [openmp tutorial](http://www.google.com/search?q='openmp%20tutorial') or 
[openmp for beginners](http://www.google.com/search?q='openmp%20for%20beginners').

The best way to learn any programming language or tool is to read other people's 
code and copy it. Please feel free to copy, adapt and play with the examples in 
this workshop. They should hopefully provide the starting points for basic 
parallelisation of your code using OpenMP.
