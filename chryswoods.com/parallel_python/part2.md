# Part 2: Multicore (local) Parallel Programming

You have now learned how to use functional programming to write
your Python script as a set of functions that can be mapped
against or used to reduce lists of data. In the next parts of the 
course you will learn how to use functional programming
to parallelise a Python script. In this part, you will learn
how to parallelise a script over the cores of a single node, 
while in the next part you will see how to parallelise a script
across a cluster of nodes.
