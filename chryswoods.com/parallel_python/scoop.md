# Part 3: Scoop

[Scoop](http://scoop.readthedocs.org/en/0.7/) is a developing 
third-party Python module that supports running parallel Python scripts
across clouds, distributed compute clusters, HPC machines etc.

It is a very advanced parallel library, currently on version
0.7. It comes with a [complete manual](http://scoop.readthedocs.org/en/0.7/install.html),
[quick usage instructions](http://scoop.readthedocs.org/en/0.7/usage.html),
and [many example scripts](https://github.com/soravux/scoop/tree/master/examples/).

Scoop requires at least Python 2.7 or above. 
If you are running Python on your own computer, then you can install
Scoop using either;

* `conda install scoop` if you are using anaconda python
* `pip install scoop` if you have installed pip
* `easy_install scoop` in all other cases (i.e. if the other two commands
   don't work)

If you are using Python installed on a cluster, then Scoop should already
have been installed for you.
