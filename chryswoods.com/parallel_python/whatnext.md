# Part 3: What Next?

You've now learned the basics of functional programming, and how
to write parallel Python scripts that can run across the cores
of your desktop, or across the processors of a distributed or HPC
cluster.

If you want to learn more, you may want to look at the Python
interface to the MPI library, e.g. 
[via SciPy](https://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/intro.html) or
[via PyMPI](http://pympi.sourceforge.net).

You may also want to explore other parallel Python libraries,
e.g. [IPython Parallel](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/parallel/index.html),
[Pathos (contains Dill for pickling functions)](http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/wiki/WikiStart)
or [Parallel Python](http://www.parallelpython.com).

You should also check out [this wiki on python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing)
that lists all of the different parallel Python libraries.

Also, for more general advanced Python tips and tricks, check out these blog posts from the [Toptal community](https://www.toptal.com/blog/tags/python).

Also, parallel coding is advancing to cover accelerators, such
as GPUs. You can code these by using, e.g. [PyOpenCL](http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl/).

Finally, there were some extra things that you may find
useful that I couldn't fit into this course. They are contained
in the [epilogue](epilogue.md).
