# Appendix: Sire Energy Visualizer Chimera plugin

We are developing a plugin for [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) that simplifies the 
visualisation of the free energy decompositions that are calculated using Sire programs such
as ligandswap and waterswap.

The plugin in under development, but a pre-release can be [downloaded from here](data/EnergyVisualizer.tgz).
