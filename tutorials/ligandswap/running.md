# Running a ligandswap calculation

The general way to run a ligandswap calculation is by typing;

```
$SIRE/bin/ligandswap -t0 complex_a.top -c0 complex_a.crd -l0 NAME_A -t1 lig_b.top -c1 lig_b.crd -l1 NAME_B -C config
```

where

* `complex_a.top` is the name of the topology file containing the protein bound to ligand A in a periodic cubic box of water
* `complex_a.crd` is the corresponding coordinate file to `complex_a.top`
* `NAME_A` is the residue name of one of the residues in ligand A. Note that only one molecule in `complex_a.top` should have this name, as ligandswap can only swap one ligand at a time.
* `lig_b.top` is the name of the topology file containing ligand B
* `lig_b.crd` is the corresponding coordinate file to `lig_b.crd`
* `NAMD_B` is the residue name of one of the residues in ligand B. Again, note that only one molecule in `lig_b.top` should have this name.
* `config` is the name of the config file to control ligandswap.

In our case, we can run a ligandswap calculation using the following command, which you should type now;

```
$SIRE/bin/ligandswap -t0 rec_fmc.top -c0 fmc.30.crd -l0 FM1 -t1 cti_gas.top -c1 cti_gas.crd -l1 CTI -C config
```

When you press `return` the ligandswap simulation should start. You will see the progress of the calculation printed to the screen. This will start with something like;

```
"/home/ccpbiosim/chzcjw/sire.app/pkgs/sire-2016.2.0/share/Sire/scripts/ligandswap.py" 
Starting /home/ccpbiosim/chzcjw/sire.app/bin/ligandswap: number of threads equals 8

 Ligand 0 will be located by finding the first molecule containing residue FM1
Ligand 1 will be located by finding the first molecule containing residue CTI

Running a ligandswap calculation calculating the difference in free energy between
ligands 0 and 1 using files rec_fmc.top|fmc.30.crd and cti_gas.top|cti_gas.crd.
Using parameters:

```

ligandswap is fully automatic. This means that you don't need to do anything to get the calculation to run. However, ligandswap will print a lot of output to let you know what it is doing, and to give you a chance to check that everything is ok.

For example, the above lines show that ligandswap has confirmed the parameters with which you have setup the simulation. Next, the output shows that ligandswap has loaded up the protein-ligand complex from `rec_fmc.top` and `fmc.30.crd`.

The whole system is loaded, but as the last line shows, to keep the computational cost down, only molecules that are within 15 angstroms of the ligand (FM1) are moved.

Next, the CTI ligand is loaded from its topology and coordinate files...

Once this has been loaded, the next step is to load up an empty, equilibrated box of water. This is the box in which the free ligand will be placed. Sire comes with its own pre-equilibrated box of water, which is loaded next...

Once all of the molecules have been loaded, the next step is to combine them all together into the ligandswap system. This involves building two simulation boxes;

* a "protein box", containing the protein in water,
* and a "water box" containing just water

Both ligands FM1 and CTI are placed in both boxes, and a 位-coordinate created that will swap these two ligands between the protein box and water box.

```
Merging the two ligand complexes with the water system to create the ligandswap system...
```

For this swap to work, the second ligand (CTI) has to be translated and rotated so that it is aligned on top of the first ligand (FM1). This is to make sure that, as CTI is swapped in, it has the best chance of making favourable interactions with the protein, and that it causes the minimum amount of disruption to the protein binding site.

There are many ways to align molecules. ligandswap uses a "maximum common substructure" alignment. The program looks at the connectivity (bonding) of the atoms to find the largest common substructure (framework / scaffold) of the two ligands. The second ligand is then aligned onto the first such that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between equivalent atoms on this common scaffold is minimised. The below lines are printed when ligandswap is finding the maximum common substructure...

```

After the ligands have been aligned, their coordinates are printed out into the file `aligned_ligands.pdb`. You should always look at this file, e.g. in VMD, to double-check that ligandswap has properly aligned the two ligands. For example, the figure below shows a snapshot from VMD of `aligned_ligands.pdb`. In this, you can see that swapping FM1 with CTI will just involve losing the flouromethyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. This swap does not involve a large change in the shape or volume occupied by the ligands in the protein binding site, so there is a good chance that the ligandswap free energy calculation will converge well and give a more robust prediction of relative binding free energy.

Next, this ligandswap system (protein box plus water box with both ligands) is equilibrated. This helps adjust both boxes to the presence of both ligands and removes any atom clashes. The energy components (a lot of them!) before and after equilibration are printed, to give you a chance to see if any have become too large.

```
Performing 100 moves of equilibration...
```

Ligandswap calculates the relative free energy along the 位-coordinate using [replica exchange](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp0356620). By default, ligandswap uses 16 windows along 位, and so needs 16 copies (replicas) of the ligandswap system (combined protein box / water box containing the two ligands). The creation of these, and the 位-values to which they are assigned, are printed out, as shown below;

```

Setting replica 13 to lambda 0.863
Setting replica 14 to lambda 0.929
Setting replica 15 to lambda 0.995
```

Now that the setup is complete, ligandswap will perform the simulation. This involves using Monte Carlo to sample all of the mobile molecules in each replica of the protein box and water box. The Monte Carlo moves that are performed are all of those that are described in [this workshop](http://chryswoods.com/intro_to_mc/part2/). These Monte Carlo moves are performed as a series of iterations, e.g. here is the output for iteration 1.

```

Test replicas 12 13 
Test replicas 14 15 
...iteration complete. Took 5284 ms
Analysing iteration 1...
...analysis complete (took 159 ms)
```

After each iteration, replica exchange Monte Carlo moves are applied to swap replicas between different 位-values (e.g. an attempt is made to swap replica 0 at 位=0.005 withe replica 1 at 位=0.071). These replica exchange moves enhance sampling across 位, both aiding convergence of the free energy, and allowing the free energy cost of ligand-induced changes in protein conformation to be accounted for in the final results.

After the replica exchange tests, the statistics generated during this iteration's block of Monte Carlo sampling is analysed. We will discuss this analysis later...

After analysis, the next iterations of Monte Carlo moves are applied, until the maximum number of iterations that were requested for the ligandswap calculation. 

```

```

In this case, only 5 iterations were requested, so the calculation is now complete.
