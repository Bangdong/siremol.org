# Tutorials

Create a directory for each tutorial in this directory, with
a README.md file in that directory to provide the main page
for that tutorial, e.g.

```
mkdir tutorials/my_tutorial
nano tutorials/my_tutorial/README.md
```

and then add things to that. This will be automatically
processed by the script used to build and deploy the website.

I will write a script that will automatically add each
tutorial to the menu page and side menu etc...
