from its visitors (e.g. cookies). 

However, the site does use 
Google Analytics to provide log information about who is visiting
the site, which pages are visited, and what search terms are
used to find different content. To do this, Google Analytics
sets some cookies that are used to track your visit. You can
read more about the privacy controls and information of

Note also that from Sire 2016.1, a small amount of information 
is sent from Sire to this website every time it is run. This is fully
described on the [analytics page](../analytics/README.md), together with
complete information on how to stop Sire from sending this data.
