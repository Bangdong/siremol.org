# Who to contact?

Sire is written by volunteers in their spare time and provided for free. 
If you have problems, please get in touch, but remember that while we will 
do our best, we are unable to provide full support. Sire is supported 
via a [userâ€™s mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sire-users) 
and via [developer discussions](https://github.com/michellab/Sire/issues) 
on GitHub. Please consider joining one of these venues and asking any 
questions there. This will allow the developers to give answers that 
can benefit the entire user and developer community.
If you prefer to get in touch with the authors directly, then please 
use the links given on the authors page.

## Tutorials / Workshops

Sire has been used as the basis for a number of workshops. These
are listed below.

* [QM/MM Monte Carlo](http://chryswoods.com/embo2014/Practical.html)

## Documentation

Many of the Sire executables are self-documented via `--help`, e.g. to get 
documentation on the `waterswap` executable, please run `sire.app/bin/waterswap --help`. 
They also come with complete descriptions, provided via links on 
the [APPS](apps.md) page, or via `--description`, e.g. `sire.app/bin/waterswap --description`. 
As Sire continues to be developed and released, we will expand the documentation 
and will provide example pages.

For developers, the C++ source code is fully commented, and this has been extracted 
using Doxygen to form a complete set of 
[API documentation](http://siremol.org/apidocs/sire/index.html).
