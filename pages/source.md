## Older Releases

We always recommend that you use the latest version of Sire, as 
the volunteer nature of Sire means that it is unlikely that 
bugfixes for new releases will be backported to older versions.

## Installation (Linux and Mac)

Sire can be compiled and installed on most Unix platforms. We have tested 
it extensively on different flavours of Linux and Mac OS X. Sire is 
entirely self-contained, depending only on a working (modern) C and C++ compiler, 
and the build system cmake. You will need to use at least version 2.8.12.1 or above.

Once you have a working C and C++ compiler, and a new enough version of 
cmake, unpack the downloaded source file using

```
tar -jxvf sire_XXX.tar.bz2
```

and then follow the instructions in the `README` file in the resulting directory.
