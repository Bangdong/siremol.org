Welcome to the series of September 2014 CCPBioSim workshops.

The workshops will be located in [*Room 2.11 in the Merchant Venturers Building (MVB) at the University of Bristol*](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Merchant+Venturers+Bldg,+Woodland+Rd,+University+of+Bristol,+Bristol,+City+of+Bristol+BS8/@51.4558242,-2.6030399,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x48718dda17a803cb:0xa46a726564b88e1c!4m2!3m1!1s0x48718dda19bc16f1:0xf749ec5ecd60d00). A map of the area can be [seen here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Merchant+Venturers+Bldg,+Woodland+Rd,+University+of+Bristol,+Bristol,+City+of+Bristol+BS8/@51.4558242,-2.6030399,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x48718dda17a803cb:0xa46a726564b88e1c!4m2!3m1!1s0x48718dda19bc16f1:0xf749ec5ecd60d00).

It is best to enter the building from the entrance on Woodland Road. The workshop room (2.11) is on the same floor, past the security desk and down the corridor on your left. Coffee, lunch and registration will be held in the atrium, which is the big open space downstairs. There will be plenty of signs to show you the way to both of these locations.

Coffee and lunch will be provided on each day of the workshops. Luggage storage is available by asking the porters at the security desk. There are four workshops, with some people registering for them all, and some people registering for just one or two. The timetable for the four workshops are;
