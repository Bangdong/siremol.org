=== What are all of these files ?!? ===

This is the top level directory for the siremol website.

See the README.md files in each directory for more information.

This also contains the websites;

(1) chryswoods.com in directory chryswoods.com
(2) protoms.org    in directory protoms.org

Mostly you will be editing files in;

* pages      = most of the standalone pages for the website.
               See pages/README.md for more information.
* tutorials  = places tutorials in their own directories in here.
               See tutorials/README.md for more information.

There are a few placeholder directories that you should
not edit or remove. These are indicated via a file called
__LEAVE_EMPTY__ or a __LEAVE_ALONE__ in those directories.

Also, there are a few 'googleXXXXXX.html' files. These are
used to link with google webmaster tools. Please leave these
files alone and do not remove them.

=========================================

=== How to build the website? ===

You must make sure that you have installed pandoc and python.
You can install pandoc by installing haskell, and then typing

cabal install pandoc pandoc-citeproc

Or you can download the packages from <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.15.2>
and install from there (they have a good OS X package. Note that
cabal install will only work on OS X if, after installing ghc, you
replace the cabal binary with the one downloaded from here
<https://github.com/ghcformacosx/ghc-dot-app/issues/41> - the link
to the dropbox). Note also that you can't 'apt-get' pandoc, as the
distros have a really old (2012) version that doesn't support github
flavoured markdown...

Then build the website by going to the top-level
directory (e.g. siremol.org) and typing

bash pandoc/travis_build.sh

This will run pandoc/convert_to_html.py for siremol.org, and will
then do the same for chryswoods.com

You can then look at the website on your computer by opening
the file 'index.html' that will be created in your siremol.org
directory, e.g. via

open ./index.html

(to see the chryswoods.com website, type

open ./chryswoods.com/index.html

)

# To regenerate the CSS from the SCSS file, type

scss css/siremol.scss css/siremol.css

=== Deploying the website to siremol.org ===

The website will be automatically built and deployed by
travis-ci when you push your commits to the main siremol.org
github repository.

For more information, take a look at deploy/README.md
