Please find below links to the two parts of the python course;

* [Part 1: Beginning Python](beginning_python/README.md) : An introduction to Python for people who have never used python or programmed before. 
* [Part 2: Intermediate Python](intermediate_python/README.md) : An intermediate course that teaches more advanced python concepts, including functions, classes, documentation and testing. Assumes you have knowledge of everything covered in Beginning Python.

Both courses are self-guided and allow you to go at your own pace. Each course comes with exercises, and these exercises come with example answers. These can be used to either check your work, or to look for inspiration if you are stuck.
