Part 1 - Introduction to MC
Metropolis MC (python + c++)
Control variables
Phase Changes - average energy, box size, temperature for solid, liquid, gas
Phase space and ensembles
Volume moves - edit script to add in volume moves
NPT simulations - average energy, box size, temperature and pressure for solid

Part 2 - Molecular Monte Carlo
Solvent rigid body moves - water box
Intramolecular moves - ethane in water
Protein moves - protein in water
Put it all together - weighted moves, protein-ligand complex
Free energy calculations - ligandswap, protein-ligand complex
Free energy calculations - waterswap, protein-ligand complex

What next? - Multiscale Monte Carlo - look at EMBO workshop
