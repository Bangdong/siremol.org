Part 1 - Introduction to MC
Metropolis MC (python + c++)
Control variables
Phase Changes - average energy, box size, temperature for solid, liquid, gas
Phase space and ensembles
Volume moves - edit script to add in volume moves
NPT simulations - average energy, box size, temperature and pressure for solid, liquid, gas

Part 2 - Molecular Monte Carlo
Sire - krypton example in Sire?
Solvent rigid body moves - water box
Intramolecular moves - ethane in water
Protein moves - protein in water
Free energy calculations - ligandswap
Free energy calculations - waterswap
Multiscale Monte Carlo?
