# Part 1: Molecular Visualisation
## What next?

You have now successfully learned a lot about how to use VMD to visualise biomolecular systems and the output of molecular dynamics simulations. If you want to learn more, there is a more detailed VMD tutorial [available here](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/).

It should also be noted that there are many different molecular viewer packages that are also freely available and that have similar capabilities to VMD. Two of the most popular are [pymol](http://www.pymol.com) and [Chimera](http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera). Each package has its own strengths and weaknesses, and, as it says on [this comparison page](http://rosettadesigngroup.com/blog/284/what-is-your-favorite-molecular-viewer/), everyone, at one point in their career, will tend to choose one of these viewers and will specialise in it to the point that their choice of viewer will become like a form of self-expression. While most viewers can do most things, VMD is particularly good for viewing very large biomolecular systems and the output of molecular dynamics trajectories, Chimera is tightly integrated with many molecular analysis and modelling tools (e.g including those for homology modelling and building missing loops in proteins), and pymol is built on top of python and is highly scriptable.
