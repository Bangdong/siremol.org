[Part 1: Molecular Visualisation]

In this first part of the workshop you will learn how to use the VMD molecular viewer to visualise the neuraminidase protein from H7N9 influenza.

To start VMD, open a command terminal and type;

```
vmd
```

This should bring up a VMD graphical view together with a `VMD main` window, as seen below.
