# Part 1: Molecular Visualisation

In this first part of the workshop you will learn how to use the VMD molecular viewer to visualise the neuraminidase protein from H7N9 influenza.

VMD is one of many molecular visualisation programs that are available. VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting. VMD supports computers running MacOS X, Unix, or Windows, is distributed free of charge, and includes source code.

If you do not already have VMD installed on your computer, instructions to download and install VMD can be [found here](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD).

Once VMD is available, you can start it by typing;

```
vmd
```

into a terminal window (e.g. at a shell prompt in gnome-terminal if you are running Linux).
