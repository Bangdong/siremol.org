# Part 1: Molecular Visualisation
## Graphical Representations

The "Graphical Representations" windows is very powerful and allows you to attach multiple different graphical representations to a molecule. A detailed view of the box is shown and described below;

* *Selected Molecule* : Used to select which "molecule" will be manipulated from the list that are currently loaded into VMD. VMD sees a "molecule" as actually being all of the molecules that have been loaded from a single input file. At the moment, you have only loaded the molecules from h7n9.pdb, so you can only select "0: h7n9.pdb". 

* *Create a new representation*
