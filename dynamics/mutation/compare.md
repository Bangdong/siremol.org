# Part 3: Mutating Proteins and MD Setup
## Comparing Trajectories

In this part of the workshop you have set up and are running a long molecular dynamics simulation of zanamivir binding to mutant H7N9-R292K neuraminidase. At the end of the  [last part](../dynamics/simulation.md) you ran a long molecular dynamics simulation of zanamivir binding to wild type H7N9 neuraminidase. In this last section of the workshop you will look at the two trajectories from these simulations and will use VMD to compare them to see whether or not the R292K mutation affects binding.

First, load the wild type simulation by opening VMD,

```
vmd
```

and then using the
