9.30-13.00 : Workshop on molecular visualisation (with a break for coffee)

VMD looking at oseltamivir bound to H7N9 and H7N9-R292K neuraminidase
Aim is to learn how to use VMD while exploring the change in binding mode
of oseltamivir caused by the R292K point mutation

  How to load a protein
  How to rotate and zoom the camera
  How to select only water
  How to select only the ligand
  How to change representations

  How to render a picture

  How to load a trajectory
  How to play a movie
  How to pick atoms
  How to measure distances, angles dihedrals
  How to draw a graph
  How to compare MD trajectories
  How to align structures
  How to draw comparison graphs

  Pulling it all together

14.00-15.30 : Workshop on molecular dynamics

  Aim is to learn how to run an MD simulation by starting with 
  zanamivir bound to H7N9 neuraminidase. Will run a short simulation
  and will load that up into VMD to compare against oseltamivir.
  Will learn about water, periodic boundaries, thermostat, barostat,
  constraints (shake), timestep.

  How to run a simple MD simulation
  Timestep - how to avoid simulation blowing up
  Constraints - holding bonds and angles fixed to increase timestep
  How to choose different conditions;
     constant temperature - thermostats
     constant pressure - barostats

16.00-17.30 : Workshop on molecular dynamics

  Aim is to learn how to set up an MD simulation by using the example
  of performing a point mutation of H7N9-zanamivir to H7N9-R292K-zanamivir.
  Will learn how to add the water box, then perform minimisation, then
  equilibration. Hopefully the simulation will run well enough that they
  will be able to see the change in binding mode caused by the mutation.
  If not, then they can look at the paper.
