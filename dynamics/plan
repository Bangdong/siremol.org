9.30-11.00 : Introduction to Molecular Modelling

Introduction and background talk
  Why run simulation - computational microscope - zoom in on flu
  How does it work - molecular mechanics theory, molecular dynamics theory
  What can we do?
  Example - looking at mutants of flu

11.30-13.00 : Workshop on molecular visualisation

VMD looking at neuraminidase.
  How to load a protein
  How to rotate and zoom the camera
  How to select only water
  How to select only the ligand
  How to change representations
  How to change colours
  How to render a picture

  How to load a trajectory
  How to play a movie
  How to pick atoms
  How to measure distances, angles dihedrals
  How to draw a graph

14.00-15.30 : Workshop on molecular dynamics

  How to run a simple MD simulation
  How to connect simulation to VMD to visualise
  Timestep - how to avoid simulation blowing up
  Constraints - holding bonds and angles fixed to increase timestep
  How to choose different conditions;
     constant temperature - thermostats
     constant pressure - barostats

16.00-17.30 : Workshop on molecular dynamics
 
  How to setup a protein simulation (simple)
      How to add water and counter ions
      How to minimise
      How to equilibrate

  How to mutate residues in a protein

  Review of how this was used to look at neuraminidase mutants
